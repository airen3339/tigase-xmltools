/**
 * <code>SingletonFactory</code> provides a way to use only one instance of
 *  <code>SimpleParser</code> in all your code.
 *  Since <code>SimpleParser</code> if fully thread safe implementation there is
 *  no sense to use multiple instances of this class. This in particular useful
 *  when processing a lot of network connections sending <em>XML</em> streams
 *  and using one instance for all connections can save some resources.<br/>
 *  Of course it is still possible to create as many instances of
 *  <code>SimpleParser</code> you like in normal way using public constructor.
