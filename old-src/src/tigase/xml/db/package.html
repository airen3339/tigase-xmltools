  <h3>This package contains implementation of simple data base stored in
   <em>XML</em> file.</h3>
  <p>This data base implementation is very simple but also very handy. It simple
   because it reads whole data base file into memory to operate on data. It
   allows to store and retrieve only text or character string data.<br/>
   Data base is kept in <em>XML</em> file. This gives us a few nice benefits:
   </p>
  <ul>
   <li>First of all this hierachical data base so you can organize your data in
    tree like structures. It looks like a file system directory structure and
    you also operate on it in very similar way.</li>
   <li>Second it allows you to assign any number of values to one key. They are
    called <em>data lists</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a whole data base is kept in memory it is not good for storring large
   number of data in one file. But it is very fast. It is good aspecially for
   storring configuration or data which are similar in their nature to
   <em>LDAP</em> supporting data bases. You don't have to worry about saving
   data. Each time you add new item to data base it take care about saving them
   to permanent storage.</p>
  <p><code>XMLDB</code> is the main data base access class.
   It allows you to create new data base in given file, open data base from
   given file, add, delete and retrieve data and data lists. All data or data
   lists are stored in data base nodes. There are three possible kinds of nodes
   for each data base:</p>
  <ol>
   <li><b>root node</b> - this is top node in each <em>XML</em> hierachy tree.
    There can be only one root node in data base as there can be only one root
    element in <em>XML</em> file. The element name for root node can be defined
    by the user when new data base is created or defualt element name
    '<code>root</code>' is used.</li>
   <li><b>node1 nodes</b> - these are the first level nodes under <em>root</em>
    node. There can be any number of nodes on this level. All data added for
    this data base are added to first level node unless subnode path is
    given. User can define element name of <em>node1</em> when new data base is
    created. If not given default element name '<code>node</code>' is used.</li>
   <li><b>subnodes</b> - node on any deeper level under <em>node1</em>
    level. There can be any number of <em>subnodes</em> on any
    level. <em>Subnodes</em> has always '<code>node</code>' element name and this can't
    ba changed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>All <em>node1</em> nodes and <em>subnodes</em> can contains any number of
   data associated with keys. With some keys there ca be more than one value
   assigned. Such kind of data are called <em>data lists</em>.<br/>
   Although element name for <em>subnode</em> can not be defined it is actually not
   important. Because data base user doesn't use subnode element names. He doesn't
   even use neiher <em>root</em> node element name nor <em>node1</em> element
   name. Data base user uses <em><b>node name</b></em> what is quite different
   from <b><em>node element name</em></b>. Let see example below:</p>
  <pre>&#60;node name='roster'/&#62;</pre>
  <p>In this example <em><b>node element name</b></em> is <b>node</b> and
   <em><b>node name</b></em> is <b>roster.</b></p>
